# Simple Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNNS
A project that involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict digits from images where the input data consists of 28x28 pixel images.

This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict handwritten digits from images using the popular MNIST dataset. The input images are grayscale and each image is 28x28 pixels in size, representing a single digit (0-9). The model is designed to automatically extract features from the images through convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers to make predictions. This allows for high accuracy in classifying the digits, making the project ideal for image recognition tasks.
